# cleanup
For the people who can't be bothered to delete their temp files on the regular (Windows only) 
  
To use, browse to the folder and open command prompt to  
pip install pyqt5  
python cleanup.py  
  
Incase files aren't being deleted or directories aren't recognised (admin issues), run  
cleancache  (#self elevating shell script)  
  
For more convenient use, use pyinstaller and convert to exe after running it once (data.txt created where your directories are stored)
